## nvblox RVIZ plugin Shaders

In this folder we include GLSL 150 shaders for rendering nvblox voxels as boxes.

These were originally included with the RVIZ package, however, were removed in 
this pull request [here](https://github.com/ros2/rviz/pull/1600/changes).
To fix this we have now included the deleted shaders in this package, installed them
in the package share directory, where we now pull them from.
We repeat the license file, under which these files were originally released, in
this folder.
